# RideShare-FrontEnd

This repository contains a modern React front-end for **EcoYaan**, an eco-conscious ride-sharing app. The project uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for a lightweight yet professional setup.

## Getting Started

```bash
cd react-app
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173` after starting the dev server to view the site.
